## Introduction

**airspy-fmradion** is a software-defined radio receiver for FM broadcast radio, specifically designed for Airspy R2, forked from [ngsoftfm-jj1bdx](https://github.com/jj1bdx/ngsoftfm-jj1bdx).

### Purposes of airspy-fmradion

Experimenting with digital signal processing and software radio specifically designed for Airspy R2, with a simpler profile than ngsoftfm-jj1bdx.

### airspy-fmradion provides

 - mono or stereo decoding of FM broadcasting stations
 - buffered real-time playback to soundcard or dumping to file
 - command-line interface (*only*)

### airspy-fmradion requires

 - Linux / macOS
 - C++11 (gcc, clang/llvm)
 - [Airspy library](https://github.com/airspy/host/tree/master/libairspy)
 - [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/)
 - Tested: Airspy R2
 - Fast computer
 - Medium-strong FM radio signal

For the latest version, see https://github.com/jj1bdx/airspy-fmradion

### Branches and tags

  - Official releases are tagged
  - _master_ is the "production" branch with the most stable release (often ahead of the latest release though)
  - _dev_ is the development branch that contains current developments that will be eventually released in the master branch
  - Other branches are experimental (and abandoned)

## Prerequisites

### Base requirements

  - `sudo apt-get install cmake pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev libasound2-dev libboost-all-dev`

### Airspy support

If you install from source (https://github.com/airspy/host/tree/master/libairspy) in your own installation path you have to specify the include path and library path. For example if you installed it in `/opt/install/libairspy` you have to add `-DAIRSPY_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/install/libairspy/include -DHACKRF_LIBRARY=/opt/install/libairspy/lib/libairspy.a` to the cmake options.

To install the library from a Debian/Ubuntu installation just do:

  - `sudo apt-get install libairspy-dev`

### macOS

* Install HomeBrew `airspy`

## Installing

To install airspy-fmradion, download and unpack the source code and go to the
top level directory. Then do like this:

 - `mkdir build`
 - `cd build`
 - `cmake ..`

CMake tries to find librtlsdr. If this fails, you need to specify
the location of the library in one the following ways:

 - `cmake .. -DRTLSDR_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/rtlsdr/include -DRTLSDR_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/rtlsdr/lib/librtlsdr.a`
 - `PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/rtlsdr/lib/pkgconfig cmake ..`

Compile and install

 - `make -j8` (for machines with 8 CPUs)
 - `make install`

## Basic command options

 - `-q` Quiet mode.
 - `-c config` Comma separated list of configuration options as key=value pairs or just key for switches. Depends on device type (see next paragraph).
 - `-d devidx` Device index, 'list' to show device list (default 0)
 - `-M` Disable stereo decoding
 - `-R filename` Write audio data as raw S16_LE samples. Uuse filename `-` to write to stdout
 - `-W filename` Write audio data to .WAV file
 - `-P [device]` Play audio via ALSA device (default `default`). Use `aplay -L` to get the list of devices for your system
 - `-T filename` Write pulse-per-second timestamps. Use filename '-' to write to stdout
 - `-b seconds` Set audio buffer size in seconds
 - `-X` Shift pilot phase (for Quadrature Multipath Monitor) (-X is ignored under mono mode (-M))
 - `-U` Set deemphasis to 75 microseconds (default: 50)

## Modification from ngsoftfm-jj1bdx

### Major changes

* Since v0.2.7, output level is now at unity (`adjust_gain()` is not used) `

### The modification strategy

[Twitter @lambdaprog suggested the following strategy](https://twitter.com/lambdaprog/status/1101495337292910594):

> Try starting with 10MSPS and that small conversion filter (7 taps vs. the standard 47 taps), then decimate down to ~312.5 ksps (decimation by 32), then feed the FM demod. The overall CPU usage will be very low and the bit growth will give 14.5 bit resolution.

### Removed features

* Halfband kernel filter designed by Twitter @lambdaprog is set for Airspy conversion filter
* Finetuner is removed (Not really needed for +-1ppm or less offset)
* Audio sample rate is fixed to 48000Hz

### No-goals

* Adaptive IF filtering (unable to obtain better results)

### The following conversion process units are implemented

* An integer downsampler is added to the first-stage LowPassFilterFirIQ (LPFIQ)
* Use pre-built optimized filter coefficients for LPFIQ and audio filters
* Input -> LPFIQ 1st -> LPFIQ 2nd -> PhaseDiscriminator
* 10MHz -> 1.25MHz -> 312.5kHz (/8 and /4)
* Use two-stage filters for audio downsampling, such as 312.5kHz / 6 -> 52.08333333kHz / 1.0856944444444444444 -> 48kHz
* Use `AIRSPY_SAMPLE_FLOAT32_IQ` to directly obtain float IQ sample data from Airspy: IF level is now -24.08dB than the previous (pre-v0.2.2) version
* Use sparse debug output for ppm and other level status
* Filter coefficients for LPFIQ are listed under `doc/fir-filter-data`
* CPU usage: ~56% -> ~30% on Mac mini 2018, with debug output on, comparing with ngsoftfm-jj1bdx 0.1.14
* CPU usage: ~170% -> ~104% on Intel NUC DN2820FYKH Celeron N2830 / Ubuntu 18.04 (usable range with 2 cores)
* More optimization on LPFIQ and audio filters by assuming symmetric coefficients (~30% -> ~25%)

## Airspy configuration options

  - `freq=<int>` Desired tune frequency in Hz. Valid range from 1M to 1.8G. (default 100M: `100000000`)
  - `srate=<int>` Device sample rate. `list` lists valid values and exits. (default `10000000`). Valid values depend on the Airspy firmware. Airspy firmware and library must support dynamic sample rate query.
  - `lgain=<x>` LNA gain in dB. Valid values are: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ,9 ,10, 11 12, 13, 14, list`. `list` lists valid values and exits. (default `8`)
  - `mgain=<x>` Mixer gain in dB. Valid values are: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ,9 ,10, 11 12, 13, 14, 15, list`. `list` lists valid values and exits. (default `8`)
  - `vgain=<x>` VGA gain in dB. Valid values are: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ,9 ,10, 11 12, 13, 14, 15, list`. `list` lists valid values and exits. (default `0`)
  - `antbias` Turn on the antenna bias for remote LNA (default off)
  - `lagc` Turn on the LNA AGC (default off)
  - `magc` Turn on the mixer AGC (default off)
